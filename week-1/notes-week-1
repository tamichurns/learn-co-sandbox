The internet is the infrastructure that hold the connections together. It's just wires.
World wide web: the standard of how to get and send pages.

Clients vs. Servers
clients do `GET`s (you, as a user, on a macbook, in chrome, make a GET) and do a REQUEST
Servers give me back a RESPONSE 
(check out the network tab in inspect)

Status codes: 200 is gravy. 400's are not found or forbidden. 500's are system or server errors.
