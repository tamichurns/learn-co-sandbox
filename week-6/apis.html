APIs:

FE --> kicks off data request --> BE --> Talks to the Data Base --> gets the info from it --> reutrns back to the front end

APIs are the way that we get data from a database in a cleaner, safer way:
1. we don't want or need direct access bc of sensitive data 
2. back ends are middlemen for front end and the data base

Your BE's build APIs off MongoDB, btw

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Go to a website that calls an API
2. Kick off an API request
3. Some backend accepts the API request
--- gets or creates data ---
4. Back end talks to database to fulfill the request
--- gets or creates data ---
5. DB gives results back to the backend
6. Front end gets results back from backend
