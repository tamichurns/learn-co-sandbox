    <p>We are lucky to live in a glorious age that gives us everything we could ask for as a human race. What more could you need when you have meat covered in cheese nestled between bread as a complete meal.From smashed patties at Shake Shack to Glamburgers at Honky Tonk, there’s a little something for everyone. Some burgers are humble, and some are ostentatious, and you just have to try them all to figure out what you want.

    <p>Think of cheeseburgers like a Tinder match. They might not all be your soulmate but you’ve gotta find out to be sure. It can get a little messy and that’s just part of the fun. Some are cheesy, others can be a little dry, and the rare few are a disaster. There are so many cheeseburgers out there it can be hard to commit to just one favourite. That being said, when you know, you just know. Everyone has their perfect match. Sometimes it’s just around the corner, other times you have to travel the world in search of it. Wherever your perfect cheeseburger is, it’s out there.</p>
